# UART-verilog
The urt_tx module is a UART transmitter that serializes 8-bit parallel data for transmission. It works using a state machine with states for idle, start, data transfer, parity calculation, and done. The bitsPerClk parameter controls how many system clock cycles correspond to a single UART bit, effectively generating the baud rate. The module monitors tx_signal to start transmission, calculates the parity bit, and sequentially shifts out each data bit along with start, parity, and stop bits on datas. The sed signal indicates when the transmission is complete. The design uses a counter Clck to keep track of clock cycles for each bit and a bit_counter to index through the serialized bits, ensuring correct timing for every bit sent.

The urt_rx module is the corresponding UART receiver. It continuously monitors the input datar line for a start bit and then samples the incoming serial data at intervals determined by bitsPerClk. The receiver also implements a state machine with idle, receive data, start, and done states. It assembles the bits into an 8-bit parallel value in data, checks parity to detect errors, and sets prob if a parity mismatch occurs. The red signal indicates when the reception of a byte is complete. By using a counter clck similar to the transmitter, it ensures that the sampling aligns correctly with the transmitted bit timing, even if the system clock is much faster than the UART bit period.

The uart_block module integrates urt_tx and urt_rx to create a full duplex UART interface. The transmitter (uart_tx) sends data based on startTransfer and outputs the serial stream, while the receiver (uart_rx) reads an incoming serial line (serialDatai) and provides the parallel byte output along with doneRx and inValid signals. The testbench uart_block_tb.v simulates two UART devices (Dev1 and Dev2) running at different clock rates and bitsPerClk values. It generates clocks, drives inputs, and monitors outputs. The testbench tasks, like send_and_check, allow sending data from the transmitter, waiting for the receiver, and verifying the correctness of the transmission. This setup ensures that UART communication works even with mismatched system clocks and can detect errors during testing.
